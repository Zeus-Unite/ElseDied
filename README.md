## Game Description
Else Died is a repetitive platform shooter. Enemies spawn in waves and try to get to the end point. Prevent them from doing so by shooting at them or running through them. Keep your energy for shooting, collect money and upgrade your weapon and achieve higher scores!

## Project Description
This project is intended to demonstrate a coding style that does not use the else statement. There is also not a single foreach and switch statement. There are only a few situations where it is really advantageous to use the else statement and require something else in the same function. The sense of the single responsibility principle in data and object-oriented programming with C# is otherwise lost.

* Data Oriented Design
* A Simulation Controller from Unity (Refactored without Else now)
* No Else Statements in the Entire Codebase
* No Foreach Loops in use
* No Switch Cases in Use
* Easy Audio, Free Unity Asset for quick Audio Implementation

While it is easy to write some code, it is often overshadowed by the code becoming more and more bloated and noisy.  There are simple ways to prevent this from happening in the first place, such as not using an else statement.
